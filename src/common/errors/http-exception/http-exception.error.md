# HTTP Exception Error

The `HttpExceptionFilter` is a custom error handler designed to catch and handle `HttpException`s in your NestJS application. When an exception is thrown, this filter intercepts it, extracts the status code and message, and then formats the error response in a consistent way before sending it back to the client.

Here's how it works: when an `HttpException` occurs, the filter grabs the response object, retrieves the status code and any additional details from the exception, and then sends a structured JSON response to the client. The response includes the status code, a message (either from the exception or a default one), and any additional error details, wrapped in an object that also includes a `success: false` flag to indicate the failure. This makes error handling more predictable and ensures that clients receive errors in a clear and consistent format.
